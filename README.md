# Antarctic Ozone Hole

Reproducible data analysis project by Jackson Vanfleet-Brown (September 2024)

## Intro

The NOAA Global Monitoring Laboratory Ozone and Water Vapor research group launches ozonesondes from locations all across the planet for in-situ measurements of stratospheric ozone up to 38+ km in altitude. These devices allow them to profile the ozone layer, a vital component of our atmosphere which blocks harmful UV radiation from reaching the surface of the planet.

One of the locations where ozonesondes are regularly launched from is Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station, Antarctica. This is a unique station in that it is positioned under the Antarctic Ozone Hole making it a valuable data source for those monitoring the recovery of the ozone.

I find this an interesting data source because the data shows the seasonal development of the ozone hole phenomenon.

## Objective

Recreate figures and plots using ozonesonde data:
