# Antarctic Ozone Hole

Reproducible data analysis project by Jackson Vanfleet-Brown (September 2024)

## Intro

The NOAA Global Monitoring Laboratory Ozone and Water Vapor research group launches ozonesondes from locations all across the planet for in-situ measurements of stratospheric ozone up to 38+ km in altitude. These devices allow them to profile the ozone layer, an incredibly important component of our atmosphere which blocks harmful UV radiation from reaching the surface of the planet.

## Objective

Recreate figures and plots using ozonesonde data from the South Pole Station. This is a unique station in that it is positioned under the Antarctic Ozone Hole.

The Antarctic ozone hole is a seasonal phenomenon where, due to pollutants emitted in the atmosphere, a chemical reaction in the stratosphere causes the rapid degredation of the ozone layer. This in effect forms a hole in the ozone that stretches over most of the continent of Antarctica and has negative repercussions on populated nations to the north such as Australia and New Zealand.
